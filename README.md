# Case-Study---Simple-Linear-Regression

#Problem Statement-

1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed
2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike

I have built SLR Model for above four Datasets. R Codes and all relevant information is uploaded in the folder.

Also I have built models in Python for Same Datasets. Codes are uploaded in the folder.
